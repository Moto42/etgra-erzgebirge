# Jan 5 2025 phone call with Jon Saint

I got a text from Jon, he is recieving auto-emails that are apparently 
originating from the contact form of another website.

- contact form for Yantis Federal Credit Union is sending emails to his email
- He went to their website and tested it, and the email came to him.
- He texted me a screenshot of the emails.

Opened an issue about this problem. Sent some emails looking into it.
