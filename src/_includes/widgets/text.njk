{# The standard style for body content included via markdown 

    - content: markdown string

    This containers job is to style *its children*, we are using tailwind
    arbitrary variants to to this. 
    https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states#using-arbitrary-variants  
    That is what the `[&_*]:` stuff is.  
    This also means the class is going to get a bit large and complex at times.  
    Nunucks comments inside the `class="..."` declaration are correctly stripped
    from the final output.
