### The best and latest in home automation

#### More than simple voice commands

Your *in home* artificial intelligence listens, understands, and carries out your instructions. From as straightforward as "turn out the lights", to "Play some Jazz in the living room"

#### Home AI that stays home

Unlike most AI products, this system does not send your requests to a remote server to be processed and sent back. Everything is carried out on an AI Microserver, neatly tucked away in your home's network rack.

### Connecting Everything

The Internet has become an important part of both our work 
and play. Computers and smart TV's are just the tip of the iceberg of 
connected devices in our homes. Texas Info Media has the skills and 
equipment to install your home network and have it perform it's best.

#### New Construction and Retroffiting

While the best time to install network cables is during the 
initial construction, it is never too late to add a fully modern network
into your home.

#### Home WiFi

Whether you are connecting just a few room with a single 
router, or connecting together multiple buildings with their own 
networks and WiFi extenders; Texas Info Media can ensure that you have a
strong signal in your entire home and property.

#### Bridging Long Distances

Putting multiple buildings on the same network can be a 
challenge. And as the distance between those buildings increases, so 
does the difficulty.

Texas Info Media has the experience and tools needed to meet 
those challenges. With radio-bridges locations at any distance from 100 
yards, too 10 miles, and beyond, can be linked together.

With Texas Info Media, connecting to your office computers 
miles away, or just getting Internet service to every building and barn 
on your property, can be as easy connecting to the next room.

#### Cell Service Boosters

Many construction techniques, such as steel building, can block
cell phone signals; resulting in poor signal, or complete loss of 
service inside. Perhaps all or part of your property is in a 'radio 
shadow' and doesn't receive any signal at all.

Texas Info Media is prepared to solve both of these problems. 
Installing a cellular bridge will bring full-strength signal inside 
homes who's construction blocks the signal, and repeaters can relay a 
strong signal into an area that needs reception.
